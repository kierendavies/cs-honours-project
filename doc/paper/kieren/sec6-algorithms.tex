\section{Algorithms and analysis}
\label{sec:algorithms}

We now present the algorithms and analysis, in the context of an ontology $O$.
We base the coverage on OWL 2.

We exclude entity declarations and datatype definitions because they cannot meaningfully be tested.
We exclude object property axioms, as well as object property assertions, due to the difficulty if identifying inconsistencies, which has been addressed by prior work \cite{Keet:ObjProp}.
However we include object property domain and range axioms, and functional and reflexive and their inverses, as these can be expressed as class axioms.
We exclude data property and annotation axioms and data property assertions, which would be redundant because their grammar and semantics are equivalent to a fragment of object properties.
We also exclude $\oaxiom{HasKey}$ axioms.
This leaves four class axioms, three assertions, and six object property axioms which will be covered.

As justified in section \ref{sec:model}, we assume as preconditions that the ontology under test $O$ is consistent and coherent, and the axiom under test contains only entities which are declared in the ontology.

Each algorithm is named according to the axiom it tests, as written in OWL 2 functional syntax, prepended with ``\textproc{test}''.  For example, the algorithm for testing $\oaxiom{SubClassOf}$ axioms is named \textproc{testSubClassOf}.

We address the class axioms in section \ref{sec:algorithms:class}, assertions in section \ref{sec:algorithms:assert}, and object property axioms in section \ref{sec:algorithms:objprop}.
% We do not address data property axioms or annotation axioms because their grammar and semantics are a equivalent to a fragment of object properties, and they are seldom involved in reasoning.
% We also do not address $\oaxiom{HasKey}$ axioms because they can be regarded as a mistaken addition to OWL 2 \cite{Keet:Personal}.
