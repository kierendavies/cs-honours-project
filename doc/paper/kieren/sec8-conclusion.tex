\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a comprehensive collection of algorithms which address the shortcomings of existing ontology testing tools and proven them to be correct.

Future work remains most clearly in implementing these algorithms in a new or existing tool, but also in benchmarking them against alternatives, and in improving their efficiency in known cases such as simple axioms or restricted profile.
