\begin{abstract}

Ontologies are becoming increasingly relevant, yet they have not seen widespread adoption.  \emph{Test-Driven Development} is a software engineering methodology which may be applied to ontology engineering to ease adoption.  This requires adequate software tools.  To support development of tools we introduce a formal model of ontology testing, then present new testing algorithms and prove them to be correct.  These algorithms address shortcomings of existing tools and can be readily integrated into them.
