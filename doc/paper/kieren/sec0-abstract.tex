\begin{abstract}

\emph{Test-Driven Development} is a software engineering methodology with proposed application to ontology engineering \cite{Keet:TDDOntologies}.
It requires sophisticated tools, but all existing ontology testing tools have shortcomings which limit their usefulness, and no formal analysis has been done of their algorithms.
In order to facilitate the development and advancement of such tools, we present a formal model of ontology testing and new testing algorithms.  We rigorously prove correctness of these algorithms.
