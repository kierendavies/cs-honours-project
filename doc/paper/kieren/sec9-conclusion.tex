\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a novel model of ontology testing.
We have presented a comprehensive collection of algorithms to be used for testing axioms within ontologies, and proven them to be correct.
Finally we have demonstrated the applicability of these algorithms with pertinent use cases.

The clearest scope of future work is to implement these algorithms in a new or existing tool.
Work also remains in benchmarking any implementations against other tools, to verify that they are comparably fast, and in improving their efficiency in known cases such as simple axioms or restricted profiles.
