\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a comprehensive collection of algorithms which address the shortcomings of existing ontology testing tools and we have proven them to be correct.  \todo[qualify]

The clearest scope of future work is to implement these algorithms in a new or existing tool.
Work also remains in benchmarking any implementations against other tools, to verify that they are comparably fast, and in improving their efficiency in known cases such as simple axioms or restricted profiles.
