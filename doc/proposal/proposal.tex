\section{Project Description}

\subsection{Project Background}

Test-driven development is an Extreme Programming methodology for development. It is a test-first approach to programming that requires consistent testing throughout the development phase. This is shown to improve complexity and understandability of code, thereby improving code quality. Ontology development lacks mature methodologies to assist the process of development. Comparatively, more is made of the process of development as a whole than \textit{ontology authoring} concerning which axioms to add and how these axioms ought to be added. There is no existing testbed for the addition of axioms into ontologies to ensure correctness. The benefits of test-driven development when applied to software engineering, like improved quality of code and decreased complexity, is desirable for ontology development also. Currently, tests are not applied throughout the ontology development process. Instead tests are applied afterwards by running the reasoner on the ontology and checking for inconsistencies and errors. This does not guarantee that satisfactory ontologies are produced.

Test-driven development for ontologies was introduced by Keet and Lawrynowicz\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/KeetL15} as a low-level solution to this problem. The TDDonto tool was developed as a plugin to Protégé\cite{DBLP:conf/dlog/LawrynowiczK16}. This introduced the idea of unit tests from test-driven development to ontologies by defining tests for the introduction of each new axiom. Tests were defined and applied to the TBox (terminalogical data) and ABox (assertional data). No RBox (reasoner) tests were run as some OWL 2 features were not covered by OWL-BGP (used in implementation) and there is still scope for additional TBox and ABox tests. TBox tests were, on average, found to have been faster than the ABox tests with the exception of tests concerning disjointness. The research into this field is still in its early stages.

\subsection{Project Significance}

Since this kind of low-level ontology authoring has not been widely researched, our efforts into it could improve the ontology authoring process for many ontology engineers. Generally, it test-driven development for ontology engineering could improve the overall quality of ontologies that are being developed while ensuring that others who attempt to use those ontologies as a base for theirs may find those ontologies easier to understand and use. Mature development processes would also encourage wider adoption of ontologies in business and industry as a solution to problems. Unit testing for ontologies in particular has been said by Vrandecic and Gangemi\cite{DBLP:conf/otm/VrandecicG06} to make the code less tightly-coupled and easier to integrate and refactor.

Our project in particular does not change the methodology laid out by Keet and Lawrynowicz\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/KeetL15} but refines and extends some of the ideas within it. Part of the project includes extending the set of tests defined for TDDonto. This includes proving correctness for these tests. If successful, it has the impact of more unit tests being made available for more types of axioms. This allows ontology developers to test for correctness of more types of axioms and apply the test-driven development methodology more broadly to their ontologies. It has the possibility of facilitating regression testing of ontologies and allow for testing of ontologies in a manner that is well-defined and simple to use\cite{DBLP:conf/otm/VrandecicG06}.

The other part of this project includes, primarily, experimenting with reasoners applied to a set of ontologies and the benchmarking of these tests. This involves applying different reasoners to test their performance in comparison to the reasoner originally used, HermiT, and categorically determining which reasoners are more efficient and for which axioms or tests. This has the impact of improving test-driven development speed by allowing for efficient reasoner choices. This may also inform reasoner choices for specific types of axioms or tests for general purposes beyond test-driven development in ontologies.

\subsection{Project Issues and Difficulties}

The difficulty in the first part of the project, extending the testbed, is formalising mathematically what unit tests in ontology development are and defining and proving correctness for the additional tests in the extended testbed. While these are defined goals, they are unlikely to be trivial. Formalising these tests and proving correctness may be too difficult. There is also the unlikelihood that no consistent formalisation exists for these tests which complicates the task of proving correctness. This is being developed as an extension of the TDDonto testbed but there may be the possibility that this new set of sets may be too complex too be incorporated into TDDonto. In this case, developing a new tool may not be feasible in the timeframe of this project. As such, the tests still have value as being valid and correct unit tests for ontology development but would lack proper implementation.

The second part of the project concerns itself primarily with benchmarking various reasoners. The difficulty around this problem would be integrating different reasoners for use with the current TDDonto infrastructure and set-up, including the OWL API and OWL-BGP. This may limit the number of reasoners chosen to ones that are compliant, reducing the set of reasoners tested and the impact of the experiment. Controlling for variables like the reasoner or types of test or axiom when running the test over a large set of ontologies would necessitate scripting to make the running of tests and collection of its data manageable. It may also be resource-heavy and time-consuming which could be solved by possibly negotiating time on faster resources of the University of Cape Town.
